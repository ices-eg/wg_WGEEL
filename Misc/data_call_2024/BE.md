Note preliminary :

I have included in annex 16 (attached) in the sheet “new_data_eel_less_20cm” all data from the import of glass eels in Belgium which were used for restocking. At this moment these data are the same as in annex  7 (releases). But I have requested data from the TRACES-database to further complete these table with import data for aquaculture purposes. So annex 16 is preliminary at this moment and will be updated later on.
