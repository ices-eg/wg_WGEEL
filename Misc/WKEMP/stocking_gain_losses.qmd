Exploring the benefit of restocking
:::

# Introduction

Restocking consists in transferring young eels (usually glass eels) from one area to another, possibly distant, area. To have a positive contribution to the overall escapement, growth and survival in the recipient area should be at least higher than in the donor area. By importing "foreign" individual in the recipient EMU, restocking is supposed to enhance the local escapement. Conversely, by catching and transferring individuals from the donor EMU, the escapement is supposed to decrease the local escapement. In this exercise, we explore whether the reported increases of escapement in recipient EMUs due to restocking outweighs the decrease in donor EMUs.

# Computation of total increase of escapement (gains) due to restocking

In recipient EMUs, we can compute the increase of escapement by summing $B_{current}(y,e) - B_{current\_without\_stocking}(y,e)$. Here, we ignore the internal stocking of French glass eels into French watebodies because France has not reported $B_{current}$.

Some countries/EMUs have not reported $B_{current\_without\_stocking}(y,e)$. In order to have a range of plausible values, we tested two scenarios for those EMUs: - $Gain_{max}$: in which $B_{current\_without\_stocking}$ in an EMU is assumed to be 0 if no value has been reported. This is equivalent to assuming that the whole escapement in the EMU originates from restocking - $Gain_{min}$: in which $B_{current\_without\_stocking}$ in an EMU is assumed to be equal to $B_{current}$ if no value has been reported. This is equivalent to assuming that all escapement in the EMU originates from natural recruitment.

#| label: gain
gain <- stock |>
  mutate(gain_min = bcurrent - bcurrent_without_stocking,
         gain_max = bcurrent - coalesce(bcurrent_without_stocking,0)) |>
  group_by(eel_year) |>
  summarize(gain_min = sum_na(gain_min),
            gain_max = sum_na(gain_max),
            .groups = "keep") |>
  ungroup()


```

# Computation of loss

Here, we assume that most of the restocked eels in Europe originate from France, in EMUs FR_Adou, FR_Garo, FR_Loir, FR_Bret, FR_Sein, FR_Arto. In those EMUs, France has reported $\sum F(y,e)$ that include the commercial glass eel fisheries, as well as a yellow (including recreational) and silver eel (in FR_Loir fisheries) fishing mortality. France also provided life-stage disaggregated estimates of mortalities, so that we were able to assess the contribution of the glass-eel fishery in $\sum{F}$, denoted $\sum{F_G}$. Moreover, part of the glass eel landings are used for restocking and another for consumption. Here, we assume that about 55% of estimated $\sum{F_G}$ corresponds to restocking (consistently with figures reported in annex 16 of the data call on the use of glass eel below 12cm) and 45% for consumption. As such, we split $\sum{F_G}$ into a mortality for consumption $\sum{F_{cons}}$ ($0.45 \cdot \sum{F_G}$) and a mortality for stocking $\sum{F_{stocking}}$ ($0.55 \cdot \sum{F_G}$).


In the absence of stocking and of any density-dependent mortality, the current escapement would be:


We can approximate the loss as the difference between the escapement that would have occurred without $\sum{F_{stocking}}$ and the escapement with $\sum{F_{stocking}}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
 Losses(y,e) &=  B_{current}(y,e)  \cdot e^{0.55 \cdot \sum{F_G(y,e)}}-B_{current}(y,e)\\
 Losses(y,e) &=   B_{current}(y,e)  \cdot \left(e^{0.55\cdot\sum F_G(y,e)}-1 \right) \\  
&=  {B_{best}(y,e)} \cdot e^{-\sum{A(y,e)}} \cdot \left(e^{0.55\cdot\sum F_G(y,e)}-1 \right)
\end{split}
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r}
#| label: losses
sumF_G = c("FR_Adou" = 1.3, "FR_Garo" = 1.2, "FR_Loir" = 1.6, "FR_Bret" = 0.73, "FR_Sein" = 0.57, "FR_Arto" = 0.26)
losses <- stock |>
  filter(eel_emu_nameshort %in% c("FR_Adou", "FR_Garo", "FR_Loir", "FR_Bret", "FR_Sein", "FR_Arto")) |>
  inner_join(data.frame(eel_emu_nameshort = names(sumF_G),
                        sumF_G = sumF_G)) |>
  mutate(losses = bbest*exp(-suma)* (exp(0.55*sumF_G)-1)) |>
  group_by(eel_year) |>
  summarize(losses = sum_na(losses), .groups = "keep") |>
  ungroup()
```

Once again, this estimate does not account (i) for a potential decrease of natural mortality in the donor country due to a reduction of density of glass eels and (ii) for the benefit of internal restocking in France.

# Discussion

This exercise aims at providing insights on the potential effect of restocking. Of course, this exercise suffers from many limits:

- it is based on values reported by countries and as such, suffer from the lack of standardisation mentioned all over the report. This includes potential overestimation of escapement in some recipients EMUs which have been reported in the literature [@h√∂hne2023].
- This also includes the inconsistencies in the consideration or not of density dependent natural mortality in the indicators. 
- this exercise only considers escapement and does not account of the quality of eels, nor on potential alteration of migration success of restocked eels which have been suggested [@tambets2021]
- the lifespan in northern countries which receives a large part of stocked eel is longer than in southern countries (for example, the gain in year 2020 in a recipient countries might be due to eel that were restocked in 1980 and that would have migrated in 1990 in the donor country), so the gains are likely shifted in time compared to the loss
- This does not account for internal stocking within donor EMU (e.g. restocking in France of eels caught in France) so gains might potentially be underestimated (provided that the enhancement of survival and growth or restocked eels outpass the mortality due to the manipulation).
- This only accounts for losses within France and does not account for losses in other countries. For example, given the tule lag between restocking and escapement, most gains are likely to arise from restocking before the Brexit and UK use to export glass eels.

Even with all those simplifications, results show that the poor monitoring of the effect of restocking in some EMUs impair the assessment of the overall potential benefits, with $Gain_{max}$ being almost 5x higher than $Gain_{min}$. Results also suggest that gains could outpass losses, however, the difference between $B_{best}$ and $B_{current\_without\_stocking}$ in France is `r round(mean(lossA$lossA, na.rm = TRUE)/1000)`t, higher than $Gain_{min}$, suggesting that there might be higher benefit to decrease anthropogenic mortality rather than expecting a speculative benefit from restocking.
