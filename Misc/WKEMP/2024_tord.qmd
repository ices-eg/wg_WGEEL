# Provide alternative methods of monitoring, analysis and reporting in which the attainment of implementation efforts is possible, in the event that quantification under the present system is not possible



## On escapement biomass EC request 1.2\



    Note : This is probably covered already. Do we mean to explain here
        how we will setup a model to build better estimations of
        escapement biomass ? Suggestion ignore this one and consider it covered elsewhere in the report
   


## On effects of measures on escapement EC requests 1.4 + 1.5 

      Note : this is vague ... shouldn't we at least split sumH, SumF other in the answer.
      If so I suggest just separating sumF and sum H as below
   
   
## Fishing mortality measures
       


Management measure are complex to evaluate. They vary over
time. They include different type of measures (e.g. size
limit, gear specification, diminution of the number of
licences, spatial fishing interdictions, reductions applying
only to a type of fisherman). They have spatial variations.
The evaluation should be integrated in term of sumF at the
scale of the
EMU.
   

Mortality targets (objective for sum F and sum H) and their
change should be adopted in eel management plans. These
targets should be compatible with the restoration of the eel
population in the long term (e.g. far below 0.92). The
management measures or reductions of fishing effort should
be evaluated against the attainment of those
targets.
   



## On fishing effort EC request 2.3
   
         Note : This is be covered in previous paragraph, do we need more ref to previous WKEMP to explain that we cannot work on fishing effort ?
       



## On non-fishing mortality EC request 3.3\
   

   
Habitat degradation has clearly an effect on eel population
(refs). Local measures however will only have a local effect on
the local eel population, that is difficult to relate at the
scale of an EMU. These effect might be confounded by other
effects (e.g. pollution, drought events), and will only show on
escapement in the long term. While a monitoring of the change in
biomass might demonstrate a positive effect, change in
recruitment also have an effect on biomass. With a reduced
recruitment, the restoration of habitat might only have a
limited effect on density dependent increased mortality linked
with barriers.
       

   
While these measures (restoring connectivity, enhancing
habitats, diminishing delays or obstructions for downtream
migration) are probably very important for the eel, the measure
of their effect shall only be visible in the long
term.
       

   
A first feasible option to deal with this difficulty to
evaluate the effect of habitat restoration might be to use
intermediate targets not necessarily focused on the effect on
eel population. For example the country might identify a list of
the most impacting barriers or most usefull habitat restoration
and provide a report on the progress in restoring these
barriers. Specific studies on the effect of restoration of these
habitats on the eel population could also be led to shed a light
on the effect of these
restorations.
       

   
However, in the long term, a quantification of the effect of
those measure would be preferable. For downstream migration
mortality, a combination of a repartition model (EDA like
statistical repartion model as envisioned in the WKFEA roadmap)
and dam data should be used to assess the effect of barriers
(TODO cite WKFEA roadmap). The effect of trap and transport or
mitigation measures applied should be quantified at the regional
level as modification/ reduction of
sumH.
       

   
A future listing of the barriers with in
order :
       
- The location of hydropower plant without specification of type
or equipment flow.

-  The type of turbine (application of average mortality per
dam / turbine type).
   

-  Detailed data on turbine type (equipment flow of the
turbine, type of turbine, rotation speed, diameter, height
of dam) should allow for the application of model types
(refs, + ref to SUDOANG
tool)
   

-  A direct measurement or specific model allowing the
evaluation of mortality on
site.
   

   
For a measure of the gain in term of habitat, the
identification of habitat surface restored along with a
prediction of the density (using EDA like spatial repartition
models) should also be used to evaluate the \"gain\" in term of
potential silver eel
production.
       



## On restocking EC request 5.2
   

   
Restocking is a measure financed by EU funds. Countries
implementing restocking should report a separate measure of sumF
and sumH applied specifically to the restocked eel. These sumF
and sumH should be close to zero when the measure is financed by EU money.
 Separated evaluation of sumF
and SumH should be provided over time to account for a better
implementation of this measure. Historical transport should also
be evaluated.
       



## Â  On other targets EC request 6.2
   

        No idea what this is....
