# Provide alternative methods of monitoring, analysis and reporting in which the attainment of implementation efforts is possible, in the event that quantification under the present system is not possible

## On escapement biomass EC request 1.2

```         
Note : This is probably covered already. Do we mean to explain here
    how we will setup a model to build better estimations of
    escapement biomass ? Suggestion ignore this one and consider it covered elsewhere in the report
```

## On effects of measures on escapement EC requests 1.4 + 1.5

```         
  Note : this is vague ... shouldn't we at least split sumH, SumF other in the answer.
  If so I suggest just separating sumF and sum H as below
```

## Fishing mortality measures

Management measure are complex to evaluate. They vary over time. They
include different type of measures (e.g. size limit, gear specification,
diminution of the number of licences, spatial fishing bans, reductions
applying only to a type of fisherman). They have spatial variations. To
better assess the relevance of management measures and since the
objective of the Eel Regulation is to reduce anthropogenic mortalities,
we suggest that each management measures should be associated with a
measure of its effect on sumF at the EMU scale.

Mortality targets (objective for sum F and sum H) and their change
should be adopted in eel management plans. These targets should be
compatible with the restoration of the eel population in the long term
(e.g. far below 0.92). The management measures or reductions of fishing
effort should be evaluated against the attainment of those targets.
<!--- I would remove this paragraph: setting intermediate is a management question
not a scientific one. For ICES, given the situation, we can only set one target and
recommendation: sumA=0 -->

## On fishing effort EC request 2.3

Fishing effort and its link to fishing mortality has been discussed in
previous WGEEL reports [@ices2019], reminding that while fishing effort
is quantity that could be easily managed, the consequences on fishing
mortality can be complex and are often non linear (see for example
various examples from Mediterranean fisheries
[@scientifictechnicalandeconomiccommitteeforfisheriesstecf2022c]).
Recently, an example in the Minho river illustrated the potential
ineffectiveness of fishing effort regulation and possible resulting biases in the
analysis of CPUE [@stratoudakis2024]. As such, we consider that the effectiveness
of any fishing effort reduction should be monitored through its final effect on the
reduction of fishing mortality.

```         
     Note : This is be covered in previous paragraph, do we need more ref to previous WKEMP to explain that we cannot work on fishing effort ?

## On non-fishing mortality EC request 3.3

Habitat degradation has clearly an effect on eel population (refs).
Local measures however will only have a local effect on the local eel
population, that is difficult to relate at the scale of an EMU. These
effect might be confounded by other effects (e.g. pollution, drought
events), and will only show on escapement in the long term. While a
monitoring of the change in biomass might demonstrate a positive effect,
change in recruitment also have an effect on biomass. With a reduced
recruitment, the restoration of habitat might only have a limited effect
on density dependent increased mortality linked with barriers.

While these measures (restoring connectivity, enhancing habitats,
diminishing delays or obstructions for downtream migration) are probably
very important for the eel, the measure of their effect shall only be
visible in the long term.

A first feasible option to deal with this difficulty to evaluate the
effect of habitat restoration might be to use intermediate targets not
necessarily focused on the effect on eel population. For example the
country might identify a list of the most impacting barriers or most
useful habitat restoration and provide a report on the progress in
restoring these barriers. Quantifying the current quantity of available
habitat and the evolution of this habitat would be a relevant and useful
proxy. This could be done for example by using spatial model as
discussed during WKSMEEL. Specific studies on the effect of restoration
of these habitats on the eel population could also be led to shed a
light on the effect of these restorations. Monitoring growth trend and
contaminant levels in restored site can be used to demonstrate the
enhancement of the habitat quality.

However, in the long term, a quantification of the effect of those
measure would be preferable. Doing so required as a first step to
quantify the proportion/abundance of eels that is affected by the
management measure. Indeed, a measure can be very relevant locally but
have a limited effect at the EMU scale if the local abundance is small
compared to the total abundance within the EMU. Therefore, any
quantification at the EMU scale will require at some points data on the
spatial distribution of eels. For downstream migration mortality, a
combination of a repartition model (EDA like statistical repartition
model as envisioned in the WKFEA roadmap) and dam data should be used to
assess the effect of barriers (TODO cite WKFEA roadmap). The effect of
trap and transport or mitigation measures applied should be quantified
at the regional level as modification/ reduction of sumH.

A future listing of the barriers with in order :

-   The location of hydropower plant without specification of type or
    equipment flow.

-   The type of turbine (application of average mortality per dam /
    turbine type).

-   Detailed data on turbine type (equipment flow of the turbine, type
    of turbine, rotation speed, diameter, height of dam) should allow
    for the application of model types (refs, + ref to SUDOANG tool)

-   A direct measurement or specific model allowing the evaluation of
    mortality on site.

For a measure of the gain in term of habitat, the identification of
habitat surface restored along with a prediction of the density (using
EDA like spatial repartition models) should also be used to evaluate the
"gain" in term of potential silver eel production.

## On restocking EC request 5.2

Assessig the potential benefit of restocking requires at least to know
whether the escapement from a from a stock eel is higher than what would
have occurred otherwise. As such, we suggest that countries implementing
restocking should report a separate measure of sumF and sumH applied
specifically to the restocked eel. These would allow comparing the
escapement per eel for the stocked eel with the escapment per eel in the
donor area. This would also enable to check that eels are effectively
stocked in area where anthropogenic pressures (sumF and sumH) are small.
Historical transport should also be evaluated.
