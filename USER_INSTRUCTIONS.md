using their ICES username and password, then to click the connect to github button, where you will be directed to github to log in there, using your github login (you will need to create an account if you donâ€™t have one). Then accept ICES to read your github username.  This way we can add you to the appropriate groups and avoid copy paste errors etc.

Once done send a mail to Colin Millar at ICES.
