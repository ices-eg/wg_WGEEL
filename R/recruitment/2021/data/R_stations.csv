Fishing is not carried out every day, but is mainly dependent of weather conditions and tide. Usually there are 20 to 30 fishing nights per season. Fishing is starting ca 2-3 hours before high tide and is continued until high tide is attained. The time series is achieved by fishing in the ship lock of the Iepersluis in Nieuwpoort. Two to three hours before high tide the outer (sea side) doors of the ship lock are opened to allow glass eel entering the ship lock. A 5 m long steeled dipnet is held vertical from the ship lock quay and pulled forward, just under the surface, for the length of the ship lock. The dipnet has a width of 80 cm and is 60 cm high. This monitoring has been done since 1964 according to the same protocol. The monitoring is operated by volunteers (anglers). Available data are daily glass eel catches (kg), date and starting and ending hours of the fishing period, tide data. Catches are presented as total annual yield or can be presented as maximum daily catch or mean daily catch. This series relies on total catch but with a variation in effort.
